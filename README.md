# Tokyo-Olympics-Azure-Data-Engineering-Project

Azure-Based ETL Pipeline for Tokyo 2021 Olympics Dataset
üåü Project Highlights
This project presents a comprehensive ETL pipeline using Microsoft Azure services to process and analyze data from the Tokyo 2021 Olympics. The primary aim is to explore Azure tools and create a robust framework for data ingestion, transformation, storage, and visualization. While this is a learning initiative, it also serves as a foundation for scalable data engineering projects.


üìÇ Dataset Overview
The dataset comprises five CSV files related to the Tokyo 2021 Olympics:

Athletes: Participant information.
Coaches: Details of coaching staff.
EntriesGender: Gender-based participant statistics.
Medals: Medal distribution by event and country.
Teams: Details of competing teams.
üõ†Ô∏è Azure Services Utilized
1. Azure Data Factory (ADF)
Facilitates data ingestion pipelines.
Transfers raw data from GitHub to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2).
2. Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2)
Centralized storage for raw and transformed data.
Organized into folders: raw-data and transformed-data.
3. Azure Databricks
Apache Spark-powered platform for data processing.
Conducts schema validation, data cleansing, and transformation tasks.
4. Azure Synapse Analytics
Data warehousing solution for structured analysis.
Hosts transformed data in SQL pools for efficient querying.
5. Power BI
Visualization tool for interactive dashboards.
(Planned) Integration with Synapse Analytics for creating analytical reports.
üöÄ ETL Workflow
Step 1: Data Ingestion
Used ADF pipelines to import raw data from GitHub.
Stored data in the raw-data folder of ADLS Gen2.



Step 2: Data Transformation
Processed data in Azure Databricks with PySpark:
Loaded CSVs into DataFrames.
Conducted schema validation and handled missing values.
Stored cleaned data in the transformed-data folder of ADLS Gen2.





Step 3: Data Warehousing
Linked transformed data to Azure Synapse Analytics.
Created structured tables for querying and analysis.


Step 4: Visualization (Planned)
(In Progress) Integrating with Power BI to build dashboards for key insights, such as:
Medal distribution by country.
Gender-wise participation trends.
Team performance analysis.
üí° Key Takeaways
Integrated Solution: Unified use of Azure tools for seamless data processing.
Scalable Design: ADLS Gen2 and Synapse Analytics ensure performance at scale.
Efficient Transformations: PySpark in Databricks accelerates processing.
Analytics-Ready Outputs: Cleaned and structured data ready for immediate analysis.
