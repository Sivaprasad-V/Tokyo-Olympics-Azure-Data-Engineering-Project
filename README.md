# Tokyo-Olympics-Azure-Data-Engineering-Project

---

## üåü Project Highlights  
This project implements a comprehensive **ETL pipeline** leveraging Microsoft Azure services to process and analyze data from the Tokyo 2021 Olympics. The goal is to explore Azure tools while building a robust framework for data ingestion, transformation, storage, and visualization. This learning-oriented project lays the foundation for scalable data engineering workflows.

## üìÇ Dataset Overview  
The dataset includes five CSV files related to the Tokyo 2021 Olympics:  
- **Athletes**: Information on participants.  
- **Coaches**: Details of coaching staff.  
- **EntriesGender**: Gender-based participant statistics.  
- **Medals**: Medal distribution by event and country.  
- **Teams**: Information on participating teams.

## üõ†Ô∏è Azure Services Utilized  

### 1. **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**  
- Facilitates data ingestion pipelines.  
- Transfers raw data from GitHub to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2).  

### 2. **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2)**  
- Centralized storage for raw and transformed data.  
- Organized into folders: `raw-data` and `transformed-data`.  

### 3. **Azure Databricks**  
- An Apache Spark-powered platform for processing and transforming data.  
- Handles schema validation, data cleaning, and transformations.  

### 4. **Azure Synapse Analytics**  
- A data warehousing solution for structured analysis.  
- Hosts transformed data in SQL pools for querying and analysis.  

### 5. **Power BI**  
- A visualization tool for creating interactive dashboards.  
- Planned integration for insights such as medal distributions, gender participation, and team performance.

## üöÄ ETL Workflow  

### **Step 1: Data Ingestion**  
- Used ADF pipelines to import raw data from GitHub.  
- Stored data in the `raw-data` folder of ADLS Gen2.  

### **Step 2: Data Transformation**  
- Processed data in Azure Databricks using PySpark:  
  - Loaded CSV files into DataFrames.  
  - Conducted schema validation and handled missing values.  
  - Stored cleaned data in the `transformed-data` folder of ADLS Gen2.  

### **Step 3: Data Warehousing**  
- Linked transformed data to Azure Synapse Analytics.  
- Created structured tables in a SQL pool for querying and analysis.  

### **Step 4: Visualization (Planned)**  
- Initiating Power BI integration for interactive dashboards.  
- Expected reports include insights on medal distributions, participation trends, and team performances.
